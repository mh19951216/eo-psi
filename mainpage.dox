\mainpage EO-PSI protocol library documentation.

<p>With this efficient set intersection protocol, (two) parties outsources both their set data and their intersection computation to the cloud in a completely private fashion.</p>
<hr />
<p>This implementation simulates the protocol with two clients and one cloud to appreciate its efficiency compared to other existing protocols.</p>
<p>We stress the fact that privacy of original data is kept not only through the execution of the protocol but persists.</p>
